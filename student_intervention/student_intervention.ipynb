    "- One of the most popular algorithms for text categorization or text mining.\n",
    "- Often used for simulating daily precipitations and other weather variables.\n",
    "- Stock market forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- The cost of the learning process is zero.\n",
    "- No assumptions about the characteristics of the concepts to learn have to be done.\n",
    "- Complex concepts can be learned by local approximation using simple procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- The model can not be interpreted (there is no description of the learned concepts).\n",
    "- It is computationally expensive to find the k nearest neighbours when the dataset is very large.\n",
    "- Performance depends on the number of dimensions that we have (curse of dimensionality).\n",

    "- It is used widely in many fields, which includes predicting of passing exams, voting preferences, consumer likelihod to purchase a product.\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "- It is very efficient in terms of time and memory requirement.\n",
    "- It is not heavily affected by noise in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- If we have lots of features and a small dataset - doesn't perform well.\n",

    "- Bioinformatics (Protein classification, Cancer classification).\n",
    "- Hand-written character recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",

    "- It can efficiently handle large feature space.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
